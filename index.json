In 2017 I joined USC and the Science Automation Technologies group, and I started working with my advisor Dr. Ewa Deelman on topics of online performance monitoring and analysis of large scale scientific workflow executions. Since then I have worked on improving scientific workflow performance on high performance computing (HPC) and educational clouds (e.g., Chameleon) through workflow level optimization and network performance optimizations. Recently, I have been working on the characterization of machine learning science workflows and their data movement and data access patterns.\nBefore this, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the National Technical University of Athens. My undergradate thesis was advised by Dr. Nectarios Koziris and focused on the identification and prediction of anomalies in cloud computing resources using robust statistical methods.\n Download my resum√©.-- ","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1631302120,"objectID":"80baf947e9f20f65405423c77d750296","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!

Small aircraft are sensitive to winds and precipitation, but the uncertainty associated with forecasting and the frequency with which impactful weather occurs require an active detect and response system. In this paper, we propose a dynamic, data-driven decision support system, with components of forecasting, realtime sensor observations, and route planning. We demonstrate our technology in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, a large urban area with frequent thunderstorms which hosts the CASA Doppler radar network.","tags":[],"title":"An On-Demand Weather Avoidance System for Small Aircraft Flight Path Routing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Papadimitriou","Eric Lyons","Cong Wang","Komal Thareja","Ryan Tanaka","Paul Ruth","J.J.
